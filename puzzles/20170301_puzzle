# This is a game of function golf, where the output of one function
# is the input to another function, whose output becomes the input to another
# function
# your task is to create the code inside each of the functions below
# such that it will accept the proper inputs and produce the proper outputs
# as defined within each of the functions below.
# You are given a list of words that feed into the first function.
