This puzzle comes from the [Boston Python User Group](http://puzzles.bostonpython.com/).

Paraphrasing from [Hex Words](http://puzzles.bostonpython.com/hexwords.html):

Certain words can be generated using the six alpha characters used by the hexadecimal numbering system: 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', and 'f'.

For our purposes and so that everyone is using the same `dictionary` use the `words` file in this repo's `boston_pug` folder.

Find all English hex() words, i.e. strings of hex digits that appear to be English words. Each hex value can be converted into a decimal value.

For example...

The word `bee` in hex is 3054 in decimal.
The word `face` in hex is 64206 in decimal.
The word `decade` in hex is 14600926 in decimal.

**Find the hex word with the highest decimal value.**

For those who are interested, I pulled the `words` list off a Mac from `/usr/share/dict/words`
