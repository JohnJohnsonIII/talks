This puzzle comes from the [Boston Python User Group](http://puzzles.bostonpython.com/):

For our purposes and so that everyone is using the same `dictionary` I suggest that we all refer to the `word` file in our puzzle folder.

For those who are interested, I pulled this word list off a Mac from `/usr/share/dict/words`
