# The following puzzle comes from the checkio website and is used as the
# basis for a group problem-solving session during one of our PyHawaii sessions
# https://py.checkio.org/mission/the-longest-palindromic/

# Your task is to write a function that finds the longest palindromic substring
# of a given string.

# If you find more than one substring you should return the one which is closer
# to the beginning.

def longest_palindromic(text):
    # your code here...

    return # your return value here...

if __name__ == '__main__':

    assert longest_palindromic("artrartrt") == "rtrartr"
    assert longest_palindromic("abacada") == "aba"
    assert longest_palindromic("aaaa") == "aaaa"
    print('All tests passed successfully')
